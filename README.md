# Kanap #

This is the front end and back end server for Project 5 of the Web Developer path.

### Back end Prerequisites ###

You will need to have NodeJS installed locally on your machine.

### Back end Installation ###

Clone the repo on https://github.com/KellyMarieB/Kanap page. From the "back" folder of the project (`cd back`), run `npm install`. You 
can then run the server with `node server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
Finally open the index.html page directly on your browser and enjoy !
